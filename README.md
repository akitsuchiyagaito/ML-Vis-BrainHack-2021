# Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Visualization with Python

_Welcome!_ :wave: 
This short interactive session will show you how to use the [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) Python package to perform basic machine learning analysis. It will also cover how to visualize your results with the matplotlib and seaborn Python packages. 

This tutorial was developed to be presented at the 2021 edition of the [OHBM BrainHack](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2021/) :brain:
