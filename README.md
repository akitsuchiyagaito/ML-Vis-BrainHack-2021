# Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Visualization with Python

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/martinagvilas/ML-Vis-BrainHack-2021/HEAD?urlpath=lab)

:wave:  _Welcome!_
This short interactive tutorial will show you 
how to use the [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) 
Python package to perform basic machine learning analysis. 
It will also cover how to visualize your results with 
the [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) 
and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) Python packages. 

This tutorial was developed to be presented at the 2021 edition of the [OHBM BrainHack](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2021/) :brain:

- Each notebook provides small comprehension exercises, and a final integration exercise.

## Executing the notebooks
- Run in Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/martinagvilas/ML-Vis-BrainHack-2021/HEAD?urlpath=lab)
- Run locally {To-DO, explain how}

## Learning goals
- [ ] Learn how to load and prepare your data for machine learning analysis with scikit-learn.
- [ ] Learn how to perform regression, classification and clustering 
analysis with scikit-learn.
- [ ] Learn the concepts of 
regularization, 
cross-validation, 
hyper-parameter tuning, 
and how to implement them using scikit-learn.
- [ ] Learn how to inspect and evaluate a machine learning model.
- [ ] Learn how to plot your results with matplotlib and seaborn.

## Pre-requisites
- For this tutorial, we assume you have:
    - Basic knowledge of Machine Learning concepts. 
    For example, you know the difference between supervised/unsupervised learning, or the difference between classification, regression and clustering models.
    - Basic experience with Python
- We also assume that you have seen the video
