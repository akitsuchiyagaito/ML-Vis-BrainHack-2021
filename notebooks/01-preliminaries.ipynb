Scikit-learn is the backbone of both _nilearn_ and _mne_, so in this tutorial we will explain how to use this more general toolbox with the hopes that it will come in handy when using more neuroscience-specific toolboxes.\n",

For these exercises, we will use a dataset from the [Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange II](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/abide_II.html) (ABIDE II) project. ABIDE is a long-running effort to advance understanding of autism by aggregating and sharing autism-related structural and functional imaging datasets from around the world."
