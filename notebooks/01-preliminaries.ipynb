    "The most well-known Python library for performing ML analysis is [__scikit-learn__](https://scikit-learn.org/). This library provides a [wide range](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html) of classes and functions that implement the most common steps in ML. It is also known for its user-friendly and comprehensive [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) and [examples](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "In neuroscience research, other toolboxes have been developed specifically for carrying out ML analysis on neuroimaging data. For example, [nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/) is very popular among fMRI researchers, while [mne](https://martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html) is most known among the M/EEG community. _Scikit-learn_ is the backbone of both _nilearn_ and _mne_, so in this tutorial we will explain how to use this more general toolbox with the hopes that it will come in handy when using more neuroscience-specific tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other Python libraries are also frequently needed when carrying out ML analysis. Of these, [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) provides numerical computing capabilities while [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a data analysis and manipulation library that allows the creation of easy to use and visualize data structures (if you are not familiar with _pandas_ you can read their tutorial [\"10 minutes to pandas\"](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html)). We will use both _numpy_ and _pandas_ in this tutorial.\n",

    "\n",

For these exercises we will use a dataset from the [Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange II](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/abide_II.html) (ABIDE II) project. ABIDE is a long-running effort to advance understanding of autism by aggregating and sharing autism-related structural and functional imaging datasets from around the world."
